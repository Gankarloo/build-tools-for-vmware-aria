### *Installer Should Ask if vRO is Embedded*

#### Previous Behavior
Installer won't ask if "vRO is embedded" if it does not contain VRA NG Packages.

#### New Behavior
Installer will ask if "vRO is embedded" in all the cases. This would potentially help us for easier support to deploy to extensibility proxies without vRA content deployment in the bundle.

#### Relevant Documentation:
None
